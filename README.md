# 🌍 Climate Change Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project


# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global climate data to understand trends in CO₂ emissions and temperature changes across different countries and regions.

Using Microsoft Excel, I designed a fully interactive dashboard that transforms raw environmental data into meaningful insights through visualization and KPI tracking.

The dashboard helps identify:

- Global emission growth patterns
- Country-wise emission contribution
- Regional distribution of emissions
- Temperature variation trends
- Year-wise performance comparison

This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and dashboard storytelling using Excel.

# 🎯 Business Problem

Climate change is one of the most critical global challenges. Governments, researchers, and environmental agencies need structured data insights to:

- Monitor CO₂ emission levels
- Compare countries based on emission output
- Analyze regional contribution to global emissions
- Track temperature changes over time
- Identify high-emission countries

Raw data alone cannot support decision-making. Therefore, this project converts raw climate data into a structured and interactive reporting dashboard.

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured climate-related data from 2000 to 2023.

### Key Columns:

- Country
- Year
- CO₂ Emissions (in Metric Tons)
- Average Temperature (°C)
- Region

The dataset includes multiple countries across different regions, allowing comparative and trend analysis.

# 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning Techniques
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Slicers
- Conditional Formatting
- KPI Cards
- Data Aggregation
- Interactive Dashboard Design

# 🔄 Project Workflow


## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed duplicate records
- Checked for missing values
- Standardized country naming formats
- Converted numeric columns to proper data types
- Structured data into a clean tabular format
- Created calculated fields for better analysis

This step ensured data accuracy and reliability before analysis.

## 2️⃣ Data Analysis

Using Pivot Tables, I performed:

- Total CO₂ emissions calculation
- Average temperature calculation
- Country-wise emission aggregation
- Region-wise emission distribution
- Year-wise emission trend analysis

This allowed structured summarization of large datasets.


## 3️⃣ Dashboard Development

The final step involved building an interactive dashboard that includes:

### 🔢 KPI Metrics

- Total CO₂ Emissions
- Average Temperature
- Number of Countries Covered
- Top Emitting Country
- Average CO₂ per Country

### 📊 Visualizations

- Line Chart → Global CO₂ Emission Trend Over Years
- Bar Chart → CO₂ Emissions by Country
- Pie Chart → Emission Share by Country
- Column Chart → Regional Emission Distribution
- Year-wise Emission Comparison
- Interactive Year Slicer (2000–2023)

# 📈 Key Insights from Dashboard

After analyzing the dashboard, the following insights were observed:

1️⃣ A small number of countries contribute a significant portion of global CO₂ emissions.

2️⃣ Industrialized nations show consistently high emission levels compared to developing countries.

3️⃣ Regional analysis indicates that certain regions dominate global emission output.

4️⃣ Emissions show a steady increase trend across multiple years, indicating rising environmental pressure.

5️⃣ Temperature trends display a gradual upward movement, correlating with emission growth.

6️⃣ Some countries show sudden spikes in emissions, possibly linked to industrial expansion.

These insights highlight the urgency of climate control policies and sustainable energy adoption.

# ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to:

✔ Transform raw data into actionable insights  
✔ Design interactive Excel dashboards  
✔ Perform structured data analysis  
✔ Communicate findings clearly  
✔ Build professional reporting solutions  

The Climate Change Dashboard provides a clear, interactive, and structured way to analyze global environmental data.
